# LockD

LockD is my attempt to build/learn about version control systems from scratch using rust.

I'm using [The Git Parable](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.htm) as inspiration.

My Hope is to build the following features

- Snapshots
- Tagging
- Branches
- Ignore system
- Merges
- Diffs
